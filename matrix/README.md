# Matrix Package

An artificial intelligence company needs functionality to create a structure that represents a data matrix. For this, they require a `Matrix` structure that:

- Receives a series of floating-point values and initializes the values in the `Matrix` structure.
- Has a `Print` method that prints the matrix to the screen in a more readable format.

The `Matrix` structure should contain the matrix values, the height dimension, the width dimension, and whether it is quadratic.

### Running the Program

To run the program, navigate to the directory containing your `main.go` file and use the following command:

```sh
go run main.go
